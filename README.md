# Web migration tools

This is very alpha stuff that are for personal project only.
Quick and dirty scripting.
Tools do not support malicious input =)

## Tools

* Libsyn/RSS migration tool
  * [rss/README.md](rss/README.md)
  * Pretty usable for our specific needs.
* Wordpress migration tool
  * [wordpress/README.md](wordpress/README.md)
  * Extremely alpha quality.
  * Not used by us any more, will never improve, abandon-ware.

## Miscellaneous

* [.gitignore](.gitignore) - stuff we all just ignore
* [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) - stuff python3 depends upon
* [spellcheck.sh](spellcheck.sh) - spellcheck README.md

Install requirements:
``` bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

``` bash
./spellcheck.sh
```
